Flat Quest Game Development
This project was created (initially) as the Final Project for a Software Engineering Course at Bucknell University
Contributors are (originally) CJ Blasi, Christina Caruso, Katherine Lordi, and Leo Orozco. 
Currently I (CJ) am continuing the project off of the work previously completed.
The project is a game that uses the Slick2D game engine (in conjunction with LWGJL).
______________________

The game 'Flat Quest' Centers around a 2D White square who sets off to discover the source of an anomaly that is creating disturbances around his home.
The game is mainly a platform jumper (WASD) controls with an added twist. Using 'Q' You can leave a copy of your shadow in a specific location.
Your shadow becomes a solid platform that you can use to traverse the landscape (mainly overcome obstacles.) The use of 'SHIFT' allows the player
to switch bodies to the location of the shadow, leaving a shadow in the other place. Pressing 'Q' again removes the shadow from existence.
This project may be copied and distrubted, It is prefered that it is not to be used for commercial purposes without express permission.
